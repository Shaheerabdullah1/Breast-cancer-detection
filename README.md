# Breast Cancer Classification â€“ ResNet vs Swin Transformer

A deep learning powered **Flask Web App** that classifies breast cancer histopathology images into **Benign** or **Malignant**.  
This project leverages two state-of-the-art architectures:
- **ResNet50** 
- **Swin Transformer** 

It also includes a **Jupyter notebook** comparing their performance side by side.

## Features
- Upload an image via the web interface
- Choose between **ResNet50** or **Swin Transformer**
- Get instant predictions (**Benign / Malignant**) with confidence scores
- Pre-trained models for accurate medical image classification
- Jupyter notebook (`resnet-vs-swin-transformer.ipynb`) for detailed comparison and experiments
